Welcome! 

Most of my work is confidential, but here are a few examples that I can share:

- [Installation Guide](pdf/writing-sample-334815-002-intel-bmp-installation-guide.pdf): This document shows how to install a gateway that collects data from sensors in buildings and sends the data to a cloud-based management service.

- [Release Notes](pdf/writing-sample-335025-003-intel-bmp-v1-0-release-notes.pdf): This document is for software that runs on the aforementioned gateways. The outline of the document conforms to the standard Intel template.

- [Administrator Guide](pdf/writing-sample-80015957c-connex-vm-administrator-guide.pdf): This document covers information related to configuring, managing, and troubleshooting a software system that enables users to collect data from medical devices, edit data, and send data to a hospital information system.

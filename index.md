Welcome! 

Here are a few samples from 2016 and earlier. My newer work is confidential.

- [Release Notes](pdf/writing-sample-335025-003-intel-bmp-v1-0-release-notes.pdf): This document is for software that runs on the aforementioned gateways. The outline of the document conforms to the standard Intel template.

- [Administrator Guide](pdf/writing-sample-80015957c-connex-vm-administrator-guide.pdf): This document covers information related to configuring, managing, and troubleshooting a software system that enables users to collect data from medical devices, edit data, and send data to a hospital information system.
